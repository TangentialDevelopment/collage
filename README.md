<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Higher education is at a crossroads. The traditional college class is becoming increasingly obsolete as we’ve witnessed lower attendance and lower grades, and the amount of students using generative AIs like ChatGPT to complete their work has skyrocketed. The way college operates is rapidly evolving and that is largely due to one key development in consumer demand: personalization.

From the TikTok for your page to the Amazon marketplace, a personalized user experience has become a top priority for highly successful companies looking to keep their customers engaged. Consumers want products and services that are personally tailored to their wants and needs. The same goes for college students with their education.

If universities want their students to reengage they need to personalize the user experience. Colleges need to start looking at themselves not solely as educational institutions, but as tech and social media companies as well.

This is the guiding mission of Collage. Collage is an education technology platform that uses artificial intelligence and social media to help students craft personalized class schedules, explore career paths, and make informed decisions about their education. We are a student-run startup striving to give students around the world a more equitable, enjoyable, and personalized college experience.
